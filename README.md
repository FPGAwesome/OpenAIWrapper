This repo is a simple wrapper for a variety of modules callable with the OpenAI API.

It's mostly intended for learning and draws upon several different resources attributed in the code where applicable.

Usage examples can be found in the testing folder, nothing in this repo is overly complicated however. It's in active development until I get bored and move onto the next fun project, unless it becomes particularly useful in something else.
