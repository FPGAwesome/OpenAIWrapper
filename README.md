This repo is a simple wrapper for a variety of modules callable with the OpenAI API. It'll also have an example or two (or three) if I find them interesting/fun.

It's mostly intended for learning and draws upon several different resources attributed in the code where applicable.

Usage examples can be found in the testing folder, nothing in this repo is overly complicated however. It's in active development until I get bored and move onto the next fun project, unless it becomes particularly useful in something else.

To use, export your openai api key as an environment variable and run one of the tests after installing the pip requirements.

For the flask app, graciously generated by chatgpt and modified by me:

`flask --app test_flaskinterface.py run`

Perhaps I can have it write a better readme with some proper markdown.
